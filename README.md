# crud-demo

This is a simple interface project used to demonstrate connecting the backend to the frontend. As usual, I initiated a React app for the frontend. The backend is a simple express server. Dependencies used are express, Axios, nodemon, mongoose, and cors. I initiated a MongoDB database to test out the endpoints.

The premise is simple: The form takes two inputs -- a string which should be a fruit name, and a number which should represent the number of days since last eaten.

Not a terribly complex or useful API, but good full-stack practice!
